      <description>A few days ago, I ran into a Go gotcha which took me a while to figure it out. Basically, I have the following code that prints out an item from a list of integers. The item is being closed by a function closure inside the for loop.
As you can see, this code looks perfectly normal for a Go beginner like me.
Apparently, it was wrong because the temporary variable, v used in the for loop is being reused by the loop itself for Every iteration.</description>

      <description>For the purpose of this article, we are going to assume we have a web application which needs a postgres database as the backend. With the power of docker and docker compose, we can quickly spin up the database quickly.
Let&amp;rsquo;s just say you already have the following Production Dockerfile configured.
FROM kennethzfeng/dockerize-python:2.7.8-onbuild EXPOSE 8000 ENV APPLICATION_ENV Production CMD [&amp;quot;gunicorn&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;app:app&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;--worker-class&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gevent&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;-b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;0.0.0.0:8000&amp;quot;] You need to create a development version of Dockerfile called it something like Dockerfile.</description>
