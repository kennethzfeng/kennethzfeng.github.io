      <description>A few days ago, I ran into a Go gotcha which took me a while to figure it out. Basically, I have the following code that prints out an item from a list of integers. The item is being closed by a function closure inside the for loop.
As you can see, this code looks perfectly normal for a Go beginner like me.
 Apparently, it was wrong because the temporary variable, v used in the for loop is being reused by the loop itself for Every iteration.</description>

      <description>Docker is the new kid on the block. I believe it is going to change how we develop software. Over the past few months, I have been trying to fit Docker into my daily workflow. I finally cracked the formula. It is amazing how easy it is. We are going to piece together make, docker, and docker-compose (formerly known as fig) to streamline the workflow.
For the purpose of this article, we are going to assume we have a web application which needs a postgres database as the backend.</description>
