<p>A few days ago, I ran into a Go gotcha which took me a while to figure it out.  Basically, I have the following code that prints out an item from a list of integers.  The item is being closed by a function closure inside the for loop.</p>

<p>As you can see, this code looks perfectly normal for a Go beginner like me.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kennethzfeng/7ea387e3a3b5c7ca67c8.js?file=wrong.go"></script>

<p>Apparently, it was wrong because the temporary variable, <code>v</code> used in the for loop is being reused by the loop itself for Every iteration.  If you ran the code, you would get 7 three times.  It looks like the closure picked up the variable whose value is 7 at the end.</p>

<p>To fix this issue, the solution is actually very simple.  You can simple re-declare the v inside the loop which shadows the v declared by the for loop although this approach might harm readability a bit.</p>

<pre><code>v := v
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you might be better off do a this, <code>vcopy := v</code>.</p>
