          <p>A few days ago, I ran into a Go gotcha which took me a while to figure it out. Basically, I have the following code that prints out an item from a list of integers. The item is being closed by a function closure inside the for loop.
As you can see, this code looks perfectly normal for a Go beginner like me.
 Apparently, it was wrong because the temporary variable, v used in the for loop is being reused by the loop itself for Every iteration.</p>
