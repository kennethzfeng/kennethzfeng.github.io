          <p>Docker is the new kid on the block. I believe it is going to change how we develop software. Over the past few months, I have been trying to fit Docker into my daily workflow. I finally cracked the formula. It is amazing how easy it is. We are going to piece together make, docker, and docker-compose (formerly known as fig) to streamline the workflow.
For the purpose of this article, we are going to assume we have a web application which needs a postgres database as the backend.</p>
